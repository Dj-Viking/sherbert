## Shard Docs!
**Shard** is currently deep under development, and as such the documentation is not complete.  
If you'd like to help out let us know in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/f5FVgr7gxX).  

As breaking changes happen often, Nick has created the 
[PSSH](https://hackmd.io/@NMrPsS1ORLq4tTSvRWdR2w/pssh/edit) (Preliminary Shitty Shard Doc).  
This is where we record changes before discussing and adding them here.  

The docs are split into the following sections:
- ~~Specification~~ - The exact language spec.
- [Examples](/docs/examples) - List of code snippets, showcasing syntax and features.
- ~~Guide~~ - The basics to get started with **Shard** and `sharc`.
